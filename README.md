## PHYS270-FinalProject

# Authors: Janavi Chadha, Zuzanna Matysiak

COVID-19 pandemic has affected lives of many individuals across the world in the past 2 years. Therefore, in our project we simulated spread of the COVID-19 disease using Brownian motion given various initial conditions to understand the potential infection rate better.

To understand this problem better, we decided to perform 5 different analysis that can be found in the following files as well as on our poster:
- [insert name of the file for normal motion] -> vPython animation and analysis of spread of coronavirus after one person gets infected.
- COVID-19 Infection Spread With Varied Initial Position -> analysis of how the starting position of the infected person affects the rate at which others get infected
- [insert name of the file for 3 situations] -> vPython animation and analysis of spread of coronavirus given people can be categorized into 3 groups: mask-wearers, non-mask wearers and immunocompromised. 
- [insert name of the file for groups] -> vPython animation on how infection differs when people only interact with individuals from their own group.
- COVID-19 spread of misinformation analysis -> analysis of how the number of people who do not spread misinformation affects the rate at which misinformation reaches everyone.

To find more details about each of the analysis, please check out the files and/or the poster.

Split of responsibilities:
We worked on the code together through live share most of the time but some of the running of the graphs and vPython animations, we performed separately.
Janavi worked on the groups file and Zuzanna worked on the spread of misinformation. The rest of the files and analyses were performed together.
The poster was also done in collaboration.
